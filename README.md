## Build a RAG application using Langchain with advanced skills

## Introduction

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using Langchain. The goal of this application is to improve the performance of text generation by augmenting the model with external knowledge through retrieval techniques. In this project, I have used some advanced techniques such as semantic router to analyze the semantics of the question, adding historical reflection to improve the user conversation flow, and combining retrieval techniques to improve retrieval efficiency. The LLM model used in this project is google-gemma2b to perform answer generation.

## Features
- **Langchain**: A framework that simplifies working with language models and integrates multiple components like retrieval and generation.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A machine learning technique that enhances text generation by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base.
- **Semantic router** : Using for query classification.
- **History reflection** : Improving query answering.
- **Streamlit framework** : A Framework for building interfaces.
- **Google-gemma2b** : Model to perform answer generation.
